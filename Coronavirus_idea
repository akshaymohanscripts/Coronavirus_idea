Hello Team,

I have an Idea which could be effective to control the spread of coronavirus. You can study the below Idea and if you think it can work then you can work on it.

As I think the main source of coronavirus transmission is droplets coming out when a person sneeze or cough and other person comes in contact with that droplet and touches his face. If we are able to control the source, that is droplets from cough or sneeze I think we can reduce the transmission of the virus. What we can do is, we can ask people to strictly put mask on their face at least while they go out or if possible put mask all the time , if there is shortage of masks then they can make masks at home from a piece of cloth that doesn’t allow the droplet to pass through and ask people to sneeze and cough in the mask only, and later they can go home and wash the mask or if they are continuously wearing it then they can wash later and change the mask. This way the main source of virus that is droplet wont spread and will reduce the transmission. 

But the main thing how we will force people to follow the above advice, as people listen to Shri PM Modi , Shri PM Modi can broadcast this advice they way he did for janta curfew on all channels so that if somebody is not watching the news channel he can get the advice if he is watching any other channel other than news channel and you can broadcast this advice over other medium as well like radio, social media etc. 

Please also tell people that the mask material should be like that, the droplets doesn’t get pass through it.

If you want more clarity of above Idea or didn’t understand anything, please contact me on below numbers:
